## What happens to suggestions
All suggestions are first reviewed by the DataCite team.

We want to make sure that in addition to understanding the proposed change, we understand the underlying problem you’re trying to solve. This helps us evaluate whether updating the DataCite Metadata Schema is the right solution to the problem and to consider other approaches.

We may reach out to you to request more information. Sometimes, we may also ask you to help us gather more information by reaching out to your community.

If your suggestion seems like a good fit for the DataCite Metadata Schema, we’ll add it to the [DataCite Metadata Schema Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mDWDeh20/datacite-metadata-schema) in the Community Discussion section to start gathering input from the DataCite community.

We prioritize ideas that have the potential to solve problems for many users. As part of the evaluation process, we look for patterns across suggestions, support tickets, and other sources. This means that most suggestions won't be added to the board right away, but we are working on them behind the scenes!
