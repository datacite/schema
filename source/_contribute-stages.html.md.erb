## Schema development stages
Each stage on the [DataCite Metadata Schema Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mDWDeh20/datacite-metadata-schema) contains ideas that we’ve received. Ideas can move forwards and backwards through the stages depending on the progress of each stage.

### Community Discussion
For ideas in Community Discussion, we are actively seeking input from the DataCite community.

We use the DataCite Chat Room category of the PID Forum to encourage open discussion of the ideas under consideration. We also may invite you to present in a DataCite Open Hours session (or we can present on your behalf).

We decide when to forward ideas to the next stage—Metadata Working Group Discussion—based on several factors, including the level of community support, feasibility, and resources.

This means that while some changes will move to the next stage quickly, others may remain in community discussion for longer.

Once an idea is no longer under consideration—usually due to lack of community support—it may be removed from this board. If this changes, we can always resurface the idea.

### Metadata Working Group Discussion
These ideas have been forwarded to the DataCite Metadata Working Group. In this stage, the DataCite Metadata Working Group is actively considering—or about to consider—how to adapt the DataCite Metadata Schema to solve the underlying problem.

During this stage, we’re still seeking input from the DataCite community, and you can continue to contribute to discussions.

Because each metadata schema version takes around 1-2 years to complete, ideas typically remain in this stage for at least 1 year. If the Metadata Working Group determines that the optimal solution involves breaking changes—changes which are incompatible with the previous version— the idea could stay here for even longer. This is because we can only introduce breaking changes in major versions (4.0, 5.0, etc.).

Once the Metadata Working Group has finalized a proposal for the next schema version, ideas included in that proposal will be moved to the next stage: Proposed.

### Proposed
Ideas with proposed changes are on track to be included in the next metadata schema release, pending community feedback.

During this stage, we’re looking for input on the proposed change, which may be different from the original idea. For this reason, we encourage you to follow the instructions on the card for participating in our community feedback process.

### Released
Released ideas have corresponding changes that have been included in a recent metadata schema release.
