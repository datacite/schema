# DataCite Schema Repository

![Release](https://github.com/datacite/schema/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

This repository holds the official metadata schemas from DataCite as required
by the DataCite Metadata Store.

It contains the schemas itself along with examples and documentation.

If you have any comments or questions regarding the schema please post them in our Google Group:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/datacite-metadata

## Schemas

Each schema has its own folder under `/source/meta`
e.g. `/source/meta/kernel-2.0/`. This directory is allowed to contain
only one xsd. The directory structure is as follow:

    /source/meta/{schema-name}/{filename}.xsd   root xsd
    /source/meta/{schema-name}/include/         referenced xsd files
    /source/meta/{schema-name}/example/         example xml files
    /source/meta/{schema-name}/doc/             documentation

The `/source/meta` directory will be published at http://schema.datacite.org, e.g.

    http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-2.0/metadata.xsd

## Tests

There are tests to check the directory structure, existence of examples,
validity of the schemas, and validity of the examples.

You can execute the tests via

```shell
rspec
```
